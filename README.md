# Autonomous navigation of a UAV in an indoor environment

Nowadays, UAVs are used in a wide range of tasks and are highly valued in a variety of sectors: aerial imaging, filming, area exploration, etc. Their popularity has grown steadily in recent years. Indeed, they are small, fast and much cheaper than the technologies used before them.

However, a UAV requires a trained and experienced pilot. This may be a limitation to the automation of UAVs for certain tasks such as parcel delivery, for example. Moving UAVs without human intervention is a real technical challenge.
